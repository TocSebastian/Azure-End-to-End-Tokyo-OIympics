# Azure-End-to-End-Tokyo-OIympics

In this project, we orchestrated the ingestion of local files into the Raw-Data directory within Azure Data Lake utilizing Azure Data Factory. Subsequently, leveraging Azure Databricks, we performed intricate data transformations before seamlessly loading the processed data into the Transformed-Data directory within Azure Data Lake. Finally, employing Azure Synapse Analytics, we orchestrated the ingestion of the transformed data from Azure Data Lake into a structured database, facilitating versatile querying and sophisticated data analysis capabilities.
