# Azure-End-to-End-Tokyo-OIympics

In this project we upload the local files to the Raw-Data directory in Azure Data Lake using Data Factory. Then we use Azure Databricks to transform the data and upload it to the Transformed-Data directory in Azure Data Lake.
After that using Azure Synapse we upload the transformed data from the Data Lake to table so it can be queried and analysis be performed on it.
